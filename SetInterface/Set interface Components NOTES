SET INTERFACE NOTES:

-Set interface => is a collection of unique elements, meaning it cannot contain duplicate elements. 

Set
├── HashSet
├── LinkedHashSet
└── TreeSet

Explanation of components:

1.HashSet: Implements the Set interface using a "hash table". It does not guarantee the order of elements and allows null elements.
   T.C= O(1) -> For operations like search, insert, and delete 

2.LinkedHashSet: Extends HashSet and maintains the insertion order of elements. It uses a doubly-linked list to maintain the order. Stores the elements in the order in which they are inserted/added.
   T.C= O(1) ->for insert and delete;     O(1) to O(n) ->for search depending on the position.

3.TreeSet (SortedSet): Implements the Set interface using a "red-black tree (also called,self-balancing binary search tree )". It orders and stores the elements in asecending otder.
   T.C= O(LogN) -> For operations like search, insert, and delete
